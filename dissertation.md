title: Perception of Mixed Emotion Across Cultures 
runninghead: EMOTION AND CULTURE
abstract: Previous cross-cultural comparisons of experiencing mixed emotion have found that East Asians experience positive and negative emotions simultaneously more than European Americans. However, not much is known about differences across cultures in how people perceive mixed emotion from facial expressions. By presenting facial expressions varying in valence, race, and gender to participants, we aimed to discover whether East Asians not only experience but also perceive more mixed emotions than European Americans. Study 1 compared the mean number of opposite-valence emotions perceived across 80 facial stimuli (i.e., perceiving both anger and happiness when presented with a frowning face), and found that Japanese participants perceived more mixed emotions than European Americans. Study 2 replicated the findings with more facial stimuli, and also found that this cultural difference was mediated by the degree to which participants believe the expression of emotion was caused by the person’s personality (internal attribution ). In study 3, we asked open-ended questions  and replicated the findings from study 1 and 2. The results from three studies consistently supported our hypothesis, showing that Japanese perceived more mixed emotions from facial expressions than European Americans.

One of the most commonly studied forms of mixed emotions is the simultaneous experience of positive and negative emotions, often termed “dialectical emotions”. Past  studies have found that East Asians experience more mixed emotions than European Americans (Bagozzi, Wong, & Yi, 1999; Kitayama, Markus, & Kurokawa, 2000; Schimmack, Oishi, & Diener, 2002). However, do East Asians perceive more mixed emotion when reading others’ emotional expressions? For example, do East Asians perceive more happiness in frowning faces and more anger in smiling faces than European Americans?  

# Mixed Emotion Across Cultures
There has been some debate regarding whether or not people can *‘feel’* both positive and negative emotions. Some researchers argue that people cannot simultaneously feel both emotions (Green, Goldman, & Salovey, 1993; Russell, 1980; Russell & Carroll, 1999), while others maintain that people can feel both emotions at the same time because positive and negative valences are independent dimensions (Cacioppo & Berntson, 1994; Diener & Iran-Nejad, 1986; Larsen, McGraw, & Cacioppo, 2001). 

The experience of dialectical emotions has generally been studied in one of two ways. The first operationalizes mixed emotions in terms of the magnitude of correlation between positive and negative emotions (Bagozzi et al, 1999; Miyamoto & Ryff, 2011; Schmimack et al., 2002), while the second  examines  the frequency of co-occurrence of positive and negative emotions in a given situation (Larsen, McGraw, Mellers, & Cacioppo, 2004; Miyamoto, Uchida, & Ellsworth, 2010. Regardless of which method is used, East Asians reported experiencing more dialectical emotion than European Americans. The negative correlation between positive and negative emotions is stronger for European Americans, while the correlation for East Asians ranges from a weak negative to a positive relationship (Bagozzi, Wong, & Yi, 1999; Kitayama, Markus, & Kurokawa, 2000; Schimmack, Oishi, & Diener, 2002). The frequency of reporting opposite-valenced emotions is also higher for East Asians, although this has only been found for  the reporting of negative emotions in positive situations (Miyamoto, Uchida, & Ellsworth, 2010 ). 

It follows that East Asians should also be more likely to perceive both positive and negative emotions when inferring another person’s experience of emotion. A number of scholars have commented on the possibility of *expressing* mixed emotion (Ekman & Friesen, 1969; Plutchik, 1962; Tomkins & McCarter, 1964), but not on the ability to perceive mixed emotion in the expressions of others, and there been no cross-cultural research on the perception of mixed emotion. We hypothesized that East Asians not only experience more mixed emotion, but also perceive more mixed emotion. 

There are a number of mechanisms that can explain the higher emotion complexity of East Asians compared to European Americans. One possibility is the tradition ofdialectical thinking in East Asian, compared to the Western tradition of analytical thinking. Dialectical thinking refers to the traditional teachings of East Asia about the complementarity of opposites (i.e. the ying-yang principle) and the view that life is full of contradictions and change (Nisbett, Peng, Choi, & Norenzayan, 2001; Peng & Nisbett, 1999). This contrasts with the Western' analytical way of thinking, which is reflected in linear thinking (Ji) and a greater focus on the features of an object than its gestalt (Norenzayan). A number of scholars have suggested that the greater prevalence of dialectical thinking among East Asians leads them to perceive positive and negative emotions together more often than Westerners (Schimmack et al.; Spencer-Rogers et al).

A second possibility involves   differences in the construal of the self (Markus & Kitayama, 1991). European American socialization contexts have traditionally embraced independence. The independent self-construal manifests in the emotional world as a perception of emotions as a reflection of the authentic self (Uchida, Townsend, Markus, & Bergsieker, 2009). East Asian traditions, on the other hand, have emphasized interdependence resulting in a tendency to see emotions as a reflection of the person’s interactions with other people (Uchida et al., 2009; Greenfield, 2013; Kashima et al., 1992). A recent analysis by Grossman et al (2015) showed that interdependence accounted for more cross-cultural difference than did dialecticism.

Thus, both the dialectical tradition and the interdependent way of construing the self can lead to the perception of mixed emotion. For example, when faced with a smiling face, dialectical East Asians can easily imagine how a person’s situation may change for the worse, , resulting in the perception of both positive and negative emotions. Interdependent self-construal can also lead them to perceive mixed-valence emotion, by causing East Asians to guess multiple external social factors at the same time to explain a facial expression 

# General Overview of the Present Study
Our hypothesis is that when perceiving facial expressions, East Asians recognize more opposite-valence emotions in facial expressions (i.e., seeing anger in smiling faces) than European Americans. In order to test this hypothesis, we created a set of facial expressions varying in the model’s gender, race, expressivity, and valence, and asked Japanese and European American participants to judge the emotions of the person in each picture with scales for perception of 13 emotions.

In order to further explore the hypothesis, Study 2 additionally observed whether  participants make internal or  external attributions when judging facial expressions . Our aim was to observe whether the tendency to make an internal attribution (thinking the person’s emotion expression is due to one’s character or personality) or external attribution (thinking that the person’s emotion expression is due to external factors outside the person) differs across cultures, as well as to see if this tendency mediates the relationship between culture and the perception of mixed emotion.  

In Study 3, we used an open-ended essay format to investigate the perception of mixed emotion across cultures.  Our understanding of how emotions are recognized is easily constrained by the methods we use to ask about that process.  Although simpler for the researcher, closed-ended methods limit the participants’ possible answers and explanations to those the researcher has pre-determined as likely or appropriate.  In contrast, free-response methods allow participants greater freedom to explain their process of reading facial expressions. We expected that the Japanese participants would report more opposite valence emotions than European Americans in these open-ended essays when asked about their perception of facial expressions.


The special format on the left is called Markdown. You can easily make things *italic* and **bold**, as well as quote important people:

You can also play around with headings:

# Important Stuff

I'm going to talk about really important stuff here.

## Important Stuff I am Wearing

There's a lot of important stuff out there, but the stuff I'm wearing is a pretty large subset of it. Let's further explore the topic of my clothing.

### Pants

My belt holds my pants up, but my belt loops hold my belt up. Who's the real hero?

### Socks

Feet can get pretty cold without an external layer of cloth to hold in their heat. I'm not keeping score or anything, but I'd say socks rank pretty high up there.

# Non-important Stuff

Actually, most stuff is pretty important. I'll leave this section blank. Except for, of course, the previous sentence.

Whoa, so much more room on this page. There are two things left to cover: the special **author**, **institution**, **runninghead**, **title**, **abstract**, and **keywords** section at the top; and the work's cited page. The former is used for the MLA heading, numbering the pages, and naming your downloaded PDF. The later is pretty self explanatory (look at the markdown source code at the bottom of this essay).

For help generating those citations, check out bibme.org, and citationmachine.net. Be careful citing Wikipedia, but there's also a handy "cite this page" button on every page.

# Conclusions and Future Study

Get out there and research some cool things to write about! Or just start editing the markdown on the left. Either way, let me know if you have any suggestions for improvement on twitter @cgenco, or through my website at http://christian.gen.co (where I also have a lecture on how to go to college for free, and other websites I've made).
